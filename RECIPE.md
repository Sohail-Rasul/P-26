-Sift together the maida, baking soda and salt. Keep aside.

-Add the eggs. Whisk again. Add the sifted dry ingredients gradually. Switch to a spoon and mix

-Now divide the dough into two:

-Portion 1: Add the chocolate chips. Mix with a spoon. Make small uniform shaped balls. Make sure the size of the balls is the same so when you bake the cookies they all cook uniformly. Grease a baking tray with some oil. Place some butter paper on the greased baking tray. Place 4-5 cookie balls on it. 

-Portion 2: Make uniform shaped balls. Flatten them a little with your palm and crust them with some gems. Follow the same procedure as chocolate chip cookies.

-Bake the cookies at 160 degrees for 15 minutes or till the edges of the cookies turn brown. Take them out of the oven, let them cool   for 10 minutes. Lift them gently and cool them even further on a wire rack.
